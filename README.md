# RFM analysis for Customer Segmentation
  Customer segmentation is crucial for any online business aiming to understand user behavior, preferences, and buying patterns. By categorizing customers effectively, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to maximize engagement and conversions. Traditional segmentation methods based on demographics and past behavior are often time-consuming and less precise. However, with advanced technology, we can now perform customer segmentation with greater accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This project aims to build an electronic customer segmentation system to enhance marketing efforts, target the right audience, and foster strong customer relationships.
